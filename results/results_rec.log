1492 (of 1492) markers to be included from [ \\vf-d4-home\d4home$\mbeekman\FOS2020\GWASday\lls.map ]
470 individuals read from [ \\vf-d4-home\d4home$\mbeekman\FOS2020\GWASday\lls.ped ] 
470 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9999
0 cases, 470 controls and 0 missing
202 males, 268 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading alternate phenotype from [ \\vf-d4-home\d4home$\mbeekman\FOS2020\GWASday\lls.phe ] 
454 individuals with non-missing alternate phenotype
Assuming a quantitative trait
Missing phenotype value is -9999
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1492 SNPs
470 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.968594
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1492 SNPs
After filtering, 454 individuals with non-missing status
After filtering, 202 males, 268 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Converting data to Individual-major format
Writing linear model association results to [ \\vf-d4-home\d4home$\mbeekman\FOS2020\GWASday\results_rec.assoc.linear ]
